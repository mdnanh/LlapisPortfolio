## Overview

The Customer Analysis for Big Data project focuses on analyzing large-scale customer datasets to extract actionable insights. The goal is to leverage big data technologies to process, analyze, and visualize customer-related data, enabling businesses to better understand their customers and optimize their strategies. This project involves working with various data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify trends and patterns within the data.

**CATEGORY lABELS:** `Action`, `Anime`, `C-Drama`, `Comedy`, `Horror`, `K-Drama`, `Kids`, `Music`, `News`, `Romantic`, `Show`, `Sports`, `TL-Drama`, `V-Drama`.

## Processing data

* Objective: Process, ETL raw data into fact data that can analyzed.
* Raw data are stored by parquet files that have been prepared in folder `log search`. With the data schema as below:

```python
root
 |-- eventID: string (nullable = true)
 |-- datetime: string (nullable = true)
 |-- user_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- keyword: string (nullable = true)
 |-- category: string (nullable = true)
 |-- proxy_isp: string (nullable = true)
 |-- platform: string (nullable = true)
 |-- networkType: string (nullable = true)
 |-- action: string (nullable = true)
 |-- userPlansMap: array (nullable = true)
 |    |-- element: string (containsNull = true)
```

* The process focuses on `datetime`, `user_id`, and `keyword`. For `keyword`, users may search using variations like `tr·ªØ t√¨nh`, `tr·ª≠ t√¨nh`, or `    tr·ªØ t√¨nh`‚Äîall representing the same context but stored differently. To handle this, several preprocessing steps are required, such as removing extra spaces, accents, and (optionally) performing spell checks before mapping the keywords to the appropriate category.
* The output of ETL processing will be analyzable data. After the ETL process, two key tables will be generated: "Most_Category_Search", which tracks the most popular categories for each user, and "Analysis_Customer_Taste", which monitors the changes in user category preferences over time, month by month.
* `Most_Category_Search` table:

user_id|category_6|category_7|
---|---|---|
0008207|Anime|Kids|
0003691|Action|Action|
0041173|K-Drama|Kids|
0028736|Anime|Anime|
0025492|K-Drama|K-Drama|

* `Analysis_Customer_Taste` table:

user_id|category_6|category_7|Trending_type|Previous|
---|---|---|---|---|
0008207|Anime|Kids|Changed|Anime-Kids|
0003691|Action|Action|Unchanged|Unchanged|
0041173|K-Drama|Kids|Changed|K-Drama-Kids|
0028736|Anime|Anime|Unchanged|Unchanged|
0025492|K-Drama|K-Drama|Unchanged|Unchanged|
